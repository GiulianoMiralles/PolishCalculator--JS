# PolishCalculator--JS
This is a Polish calculator (reverse notation). In reverse Polish notation it is the other way around: first there are the operands and then comes the operator that will perform the calculations on them. You do not need to use parentheses to indicate the order of operations, as long as the arity of the operator is fixed. It does not require installation since it is done in native JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
